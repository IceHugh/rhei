- **Notifications**: System notifications for timer events (`flutter_local_notifications`).
- **Android Widget**: 
  - Real-time timer display with circular progress indicator
  - Smart pause control (only available during Focus mode, hidden during breaks)
  - Performance-optimized with state caching to prevent UI flickering
  - Syncs colors and background settings from main app

  - Portrait/landscape optimization
  - Modern bottom-sheet image manager
  - Background type selection: Default gradient, Solid color, or Image carousel
- **Window Control**: "Always on Top" and other window management features (`window_manager`).

- **Performance**: High-resolution image caching, memory optimization, and persistent background storage.
- **Platforms**: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows.
