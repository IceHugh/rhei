## 🧑‍💻 Development

### Generating App Icons
If you update `logo.png`, regenerate the platform-specific icons:

dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

flutter analyze
```


## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### macOS: "App is damaged" or "Unverified Developer"
If you see a warning that "Rhei cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software":

1.  Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**.
2.  Scroll down to the security section and click **"Open Anyway"** for Rhei.

Alternatively, running this command in Terminal will verify the app:
